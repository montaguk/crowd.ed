crowd.ed
========

crowd.ed (pronounced "crowded") is a crowd-powered political information
platform.

The main goal of the project is to empower citizens in the
ever-increasing challenge of keeping our ellected officials accountable
to those they represent.

The project will progress through several phases; each of which
requiring contributions from various persons, with a wide range of
skills.

Phase 1. Platform Development
Primary contributors during this phase will be software developers.  During
this phase we will work to develop the software platform that will serve
as the foundation for the remainder of the project.

Deliverables:
A software platform that supports the needs of the following phases.

Phase 2. Deployment
During this phase, we will deploy the software platform, making it available
to the general public.  This phase will likely require a substantial financial
investment to provide the server processing power and up-time required by the
platform.  Again, software developers will largely be contributing during
this phase, however, we may (and probably should) reach out to the general
public for financial support.

It is vital that we get the word out about the project during this phase.
Possible avenues are social media, and other crowd-sourced information
sharing sites (and possibly investment sites) such as kickstarter.

Deliverables:
A publicly accessible platform that users can access and interact with.
Enough funding to cover hosting, and any other fees/costs associated w/
running a website.

Phase 3. Data Collection
Contributions during this phase will largely come from the general public.
It is during this phase that we are collecting information on various
public representatives.  At the very least, we should be tracking
congressional voting records, bill contents/summaries, etc, all of which
will be coming from data input from users.

During this phase, software developers continue to develop the platform,
adding new features and addressing issues as they arise.

Deliverables:
A collection of information regarding elected officials, their voting
histories, and any other information that is deemed useful to the
end user.

Phase 4. Data Mining/Processing
Once a substantial amount of data has been collected, we can begin using
data mining techniques to further analyze the data. The goal here is to 
provide citizens with a more interactive experience, and more valuable
information.

Deliverables:
The platform can provide the user with candidate suggestions,
potential outcomes of votes, etc.
