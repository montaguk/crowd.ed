Contributing
============

Since crowd.ed is a crowd-powered project, things only get done when people pitch in.  We are always
in need of support from software developers to build and expand our software platform.  If you
are interested in joining the development effort, check out the :doc:`Developers Page </developers>`.

Unfortunately, since we don't have the platform completed yet, we're not quite ready to accept
major contributions from *non-technical* types.  However, don't be discouraged!  Once we have the
platform up and running, there will be plenty of work to go around.  If you would like to stay
informed of our progress, you can join our mailing list, and we'll let you know when we're ready
for some more help!

Finally, if you don't have the time to donate but still would like to contribute to the cause,
we do accept financial donations to help keep the lights on.  Since all of our work comes from
volunteers, you can be rest assured that your money is always going to supporting the project.
